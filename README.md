# T-Spark

A collection of my works at the 2020 Tencent T-Spark Future Academy National Extended Hackathon and 2021 Tencent T-Spark Challenge Programme (Short Video Recommendation Algorithms track).
Note: * Most of the content might be in Chinese, as the programmes were conducted in Chinese.
      * This is just a folder of some "important content" I saved. It is not thoroughly formatted or compiled.
